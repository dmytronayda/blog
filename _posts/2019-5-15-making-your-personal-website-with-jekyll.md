title: Making a personal website with Jekyll
description: Feugiat amet tempus
---
**In this article I try to condence everything I've learned about Jekyll and help you create your own website for free.**

I've tried to create my personal website several times by now using my somewhat limited knowledge of HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript.

I actually created a decent [portfolio website](http://www.dmytronaida.com/) right after the completion of the online
course Building Websites from Scratch from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).

I wanted to go one step further and add blog section. That's when I realised that I needed some kind of CMS (Content
Management System) or a site generator to take away the hassle of creating & copy-pasting HTML files for every new post.
On top of that, I wanted to optimize SEO and loading speed.

### My requirements for the site generator were:
1. Automate the process of creating blog posts / articles
2. Easy to set up and manage
3. Free to host online ( e.g. with GitHub pages )
4. Ability to set up a custom domain name (e.g. dmytronaida.com)

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) met all the criteria above. It is open-source, easy to set up and most importantly
__completely FREE__ to host on GitHub pages.

### Prerequisites
1. Basic knowledge of [HTML & CSS](https://internetingishard.com/)
2. Basic knowledge of [command line](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-the-command-line-for-apple-macos-and-linux/)
3. A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
4. A text editor on your machine (e.g. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))


## Install Jekyll

1. **Open terminal** on your computer:

    For Mac, press `Cmd + Space` and start typing `terminal`.
    Then, hit `Enter` to open the command line.

2. **Install Command Line Tools**

    Check to see if you have Command Line Tools on your machine already:
    ```sh
    gcc -v
    ```
    You should see the version of the command line tools you are using if you have them installed. Otherwise, you will be
    prompted to install them on your machine. Or, just type in your terminal:
    ```sh
    xcode-select --install
    ```
3. **Install Ruby**

    ```sh
    # Install Homebrew
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

    brew install ruby
    ```
    and add it to your shell config:
    * clear the terminal;
    * go back to your home directory `cd`;
    * open `nano ~/.bash_profile` from your terminal;
    * and add a new line `export PATH=/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH`

    ![add new line nano editor](/assets/images/add_new_line.png)

    * Save and close the file
    * `Ctr + O` to save
    * and, `Ctr + X` to close

    Last thing, is to relaunch your terminal and check your updated Ruby setup
    ```sh
    which ruby
    # /usr/local/opt/ruby/bin/ruby

    ruby -v
    # ruby 2.6.2p47 (2019-03-13 revision 67232) [x86_64-darwin18]
    ```
4. **Install Jekyll**

    Now your should be ready to install the Jekyll itself.
    * ```sh
    gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
    ```
    * check the Ruby version:
    ```sh
    ruby -v
    # ruby 2.6.1p33 (2019-01-30 revision 66950) [x86_64-darwin18]
    ```
    * Then append your path file with the following, replacing the `X.X` with the first two digits of your Ruby version.
    ```sh
    export PATH=$HOME/.gem/ruby/X.X.0/bin:$PATH
    ```
    * to check that your gem paths point to your home directory run `gem env` and make sure that `GEM PATHS:` points to a
    path in your home directory.


## Create a custom website running on Jekyll

![Mediumish](/assets/images/jekyll-site-preview.png)

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
    <a class="button" target="_blank" href="https://wowthemesnet.github.io/mediumish-theme-jekyll">
        <i class="fa fa-eye"></i> Live Demo
    </a>
</div>
<br>
Now, that you have Jekyll on your machine, we are ready to proceed and create your website.

For the purpose of example I am going to use the Medium-style blog theme **Mediumish**.


1. Log in to your GitHub account and fork Mediumish: [https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll/](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll/)

    ![fork-mediumish](/assets/images/fork-mediumish.png)

2. Clone a copy of your fork on your machine and open with a text editor of your choice: 
     ![](/assets/images/clone-a-copy-of-your-fork.png)
    
    Or simply use following commands in your terminal if you use VS Code:  

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll.git
    cd mediumish-theme-jekyll/
    code . 
    ```

3. To see the website template in your browser, type the following in your terminal: 

    ```
    bundle exec jekyll build 
    bundle exec jekyll serve 
    ```
    This will create a local server on your machine, so that you could simply follow the link `Cmd + Click` or copy-paste it to your browser window. It should look something like this: `Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/mediumish-theme-jekyll/` 

4. Now head to `_config.yml` file and update it to your liking. Add your logo, author/s, mailchimp, etc. 

## Deploy your website for free to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a gret place to store and deploy your Jekyll website for free. In fact, GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll. 

The only thing which I paid for in the end is my custom domain name. It costed me around $3-4/year for [dmytronaida.com](http://www.dmytronaida.com/). You can search how to buy a domain name on Google. 

On contrary, you can omit using custom domain and just go with the defaul one provided automatically by GitHub Pages. It will look like this `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`

### What is deploying? 

Deploying is pretty much like publishing. 

When writers are ready with their book, they publish it. When developers are ready to share their projects, they deploy them to the Internet. 

### Deployment on GitHub Pages

Deploying to GitHub Pages is automatic. Once your Jekyll site is set up, deploying happens whenever you push your local changes to your remote, GitHub-hosted repository. 

Head to GitHub Pagesâ€™ [**setup instructions**](https://pages.github.com/) and follow the steps exactly to get your main GitHub Pages page setup.

That's about it. Simply navigate to GitHub repo and click `Settings`:

Within `Settings`, navigate to the `Source` section. From the dropdown menu, select `master` branch and then click `Save`.

Now, your Jekyll site can be found at `http://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>` 

If you want to change anything on your website, simply commit new change to your repository. 

And, in case you want to use a custom domain, please refer to official instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages).
