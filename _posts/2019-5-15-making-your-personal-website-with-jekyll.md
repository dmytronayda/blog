I've tried to create my personal website several times by now using my somewhat limited knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I actually created a decent [portfolio website](http://www.dmytronaida.com/) right after the completion of the online course Building Websites from Scratch from Codecademy. 

I wanted to go one step further and add blog section to my website. That's when I realised that I needed some kind of CMS (Content management system) or a site generator to take away the hassle of creating & copy-pasting HTML files for every new post. On top of that, I wanted to optimize SEO and loading speed. 

### My requirements for the site generator were: 
1. Automate the process of creating blog posts / articles 
2. Easy to set up and manage 
3. Free to host online ( e.g. with GitHub pages )
4. Ability to set up a custom domain name (e.g. dmytronaida.com)

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) met all the criteria above. It is open-source, easy to set up and most importantly __completely FREE__ to host on GitHub pages. 

In this article I try to condence everything I've learned about Jekyll and help you create your own website for free. 

### Prerequisites
1. Basic knowledge of [HTML & CSS](https://internetingishard.com/)
2. Basic knowledge of [command line](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-the-command-line-for-apple-macos-and-linux/)  
3. A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
4. A text editor on your machine (e.g. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Install Jekyll
For installing Jekyll, I assume you haven't try using terminal in the past and/or have any prior programming experience. 

1.  Open terminal on your computer: 

    For Mac, press `Cmd + Space` and start typing `terminal`. 
    Then, hit `Enter` to open the command line.
