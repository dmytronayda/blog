**My main goal for this online training was to learn more hands-on skills for game/product analytics so that to better understand and improve our games monetization and user experience.**

### What got me hooked? 
1. Testimonials 
   * For me, the feedback from Michail Katkoff, founder of [Deconstructor of Fun](https://www.deconstructoroffun.com/blog) was most important. In the meantime, there are lots of other relevant testimonials from guys working for Zeptolab, Facebook, TechCrunch and more.

2. This training uses [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) to teach you product analytics
   * At work I am using [Leanplum](https://www.leanplum.com/) for event-based analytics. So, I figured that training which uses similar analytics tool will be quite beneficial.
3. Curriculum
   * Course curriculum topics range from basics like ROI, Cohort analytics and go to A/B testing, Evaluation of new feature potential, ASO. 

 
### What's the time commitment? 
According to the landing page of the Go Practice website, "If you spend one hour a day, it will take you about 1-1.5 months to complete the course." 

In my case it actually was way longer: flu, vacay,.. well, you know, life happens. 

To be precise, I spent 2 months and 16 days to complete the course. Median learning session for me was 1:08:30 and total time commitment 39:37:09. So, it's actually reasonable to say you gonna spend around 1-1.5 months to complete GoPractice if you do it 1hr every day.

### What was useful? 

1. Tons of hands-on exercises 
   * Guys at GoPractice took phase 'learning by doing' quite seriously. You have to understand the topic you read through and actually do calculations yourself (mainly in Google Spreadsheets)  or *make educated guesses* to access new material. What's even cooler is that you end the course having over 20 ready-to-use and adapt for your own needs Spreadsheets. So, next time you're willing to estimate the audience or LTV of your app/game for the first 100 days when you have data only for first month, you don't have to start from scratch. 
2. Instant feedback 
   * For me, that feels awesome when you can get an instant "great job, man" or "do you even read instructions" feedback. After typing in your answer and pressing `Enter` you immediately get some quality feedback:

3. Course gives you a full picture about digital product management from main value definition and metrics to post-release feature improvement. Most useful topics and ideas for me personally were: 
   * Getting user feedback as early as possible. 
   I really enjoyed the topic about user testing. It has a lot of insights on how to conduct user testing and personal user interviews in particular. 
   * A/B test as much as you can
   * App Store Optimization topic provided a lot of useful materials for keywords research, online tools and actionable how-to's 
4. Real-world examples
   * Course gives a lot of real-world examples for digital product market benchmarks, stories for how products were originally looking for their real value, ROI-positive distribution channels, etc. The cherry on top is that you get plenty examples for mobile games market products.  

5. General idea of questioning everything
   * After spending ±40hrs working on this training, you gain or reinforce a life-saving skill to not take any information for granted. It helps you shift away from *this should work* to *let's test this hypothesis* mindset. 
   
   That is, next time you won't fall for Müller-Lyer illusion [1] and will first measure before jumping to any conclusions:

### How can it get better? 

1. Graded assignments  
  * That would be great to get even more practice and work on some bigger projects. Here's a great example of how this was done for Codecademy Pro Intensive course on website development: [https://github.com/dmytronayda/colmar-academy/issues](https://github.com/dmytronayda/colmar-academy/issues) 
  [![Codecademy Pro Intensive -- Project Feedback in GitHub Issues](https://i.ibb.co/J3VqHYf/https-i-ytimg-com-vi-3ys-Z9-E1dk-E-maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3ys_Z9E1dkE "Codecademy Pro Intensive -- Project Feedback in GitHub Issues")
2. After completion of the training that would be awesome to get access to a product management competitions.    

    Something similar to Kaggle competitions: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)  with main prize being chance for interview/ cooperation/ job offer/ some king of promotion or featuring, etc.
You can obviously say that this deserves a separate product... 🤷‍♂️
3. Actively reach out to users with their progress to keep them motivated. 
    
    I think weekly progress e-mail would not be too intrusive. I personally like contribution reports from Google Maps Local Guides:

4. Facebook learner community is not really active right now. 

    It feels like learners of such training should really get more knowledge and opportunities sharing.  

> These are my personal improvement features suggestions. If you think that they don't make sense or, on contrary, might be useful, make sure to drop me a line on the email. Would be interesting to hear your opinion. 

### Summary: 
All in all, Simulator by GoPractice! is the incredible resource to learn about growth and data-driven product management.
